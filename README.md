Overview
The Task Management System is a web-based application that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. It provides two primary interfaces:

Admin Dashboard: For administrators to manage users, tasks, and perform other administrative functions.
User Dashboard: For regular users to manage their tasks and view relevant task-related information.
The application features a login page to authenticate users before granting access to the dashboards. It supports user roles, with different access rights for admins and regular users.
